		<h1>Q & A</h1>


		<h3>How long is a workout session with the Lucy Method?</h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>A single session lasts 75 minutes.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>How long will Lucy Method program last?</h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>It varies, depending on current fitness levels and goals, but the estimated time to complete Lucy Method Training Program is 12 weeks. The optimal number of sessions per week will be determined during the 30/30.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Can I book single sessions?</h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>Yes. Circumstances in a human’s life may make it difficult for them to follow a 12 week program, so Lucy Method also offers single sessions.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Where do The Lucy Method training sessions take place?</h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>The training sessions are best held in one of the many open air environments all across Amsterdam. However, this can be changed to better fit the customer’s needs. We can also book sessions in private, local fields or locations.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Are there group sessions?</h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>Lucy Method is designed to meet and improve the specific fitness needs of individuals, so group sessions are not possible. We do offer sessions for two people at once, to better accommodate couples or workout partners. Lucy Method requires that participants receive individualized attention. More than two people at a time makes this impractical.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Does The Lucy Method require any exercise equipment?</h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>Some. Lucy Method will determine and provide exactly the equipment you will need, when we create your customized training program.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Will sessions still be held outside during cold or rainy weather?</h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>Yes. Sessions in cold weather can be an invigorating challenge that strengthens your heart, lungs, and circulatory system. The cold stimulates your parasympathetic system, by way of the Vagus nerve, kicking in your natural relax and renew response. This is the opposite of the parasympathetic system is the sympathetic system, which is your fight or flight response. Stimulating the parasympathetic system triggers the release of dopamine and serotonin which keeps us happy, feeling good, and eases depression.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Can I have a Lucy Method session at my local gym?</h3>
		<div class="answer">
			<p>Possibly. Check with your gym or let us do that. We are constantly working to get more partners.
			</p>

		<h3>How much does Lucy Method charge?</h3>
		<div class="answer">

		</div>

		<h3>Am I obligated to sign up for Lucy Method after the 30/30 consultation?</h3>
		<div class="answer">
