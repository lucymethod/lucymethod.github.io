          <b>The ideal urban human</b><br>
          Everyone of us has their own image of such a strong and healthy human.<br>
          And it is an individuate image because all of us have different backgrounds and history.<br>
          But we all imagine a disciplined and lively mind under the surface of this strong and healthy human.<br>
          This means that not only the body is the goal but the mind of such an ideal person as well.<br>
          To evolve into such an ideal human, we should first study the birth of humanity.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>History</b><br>
          Lucy Method is grounded on experience of modern humans and research papers dealt with the first humans. <br>
          It embraces the lifestyle of homo sapience of the period nor less then 3.2 million years. <br>
          That is the age of Lucy. <br>
          Lucy is a collection of fossilized bones which were discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. <br>
          The bones made up a skeleton of the hominin species Australopithecus afarensis. <br>
          Lucy is the most important fossile ever discovered in archeology.<br>
          The assembly showed that Lucy moved upright.<br>
          By studying her bones and in particular the structure of her knee and spine curvature.<br>
          Scientist were able to discover that she spent most of her time moving on two legs, like humans.<br>
          The method has been elaborated with as much simplicity of this prehistoric experience as possible. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Back to the movement</b><br>
          Lucy Method combines physical exercises and otherworldliness editations. <br>
          Moreover combined with knowledge of nutrition and livestyles. <br>
          As Lucy was the first hominid the main idea of the method is “back to the movement”. <br>
          The method proves that people should look back through millions of years and become opportunistic movers again. <br>
          It should be done for many reasons and the main one is to heal our bodies.<br>
          Our locomotion is tough and it doesn’t give us the opportunity to expand freedom of movement in our ordinary habitual life.<br>
          Lucy Method combines all the possible ways of expressing freedom of our body, where limitation are causing health problems.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>You have always been</b><br>
          We should be ready to admit that people are part of evolution.<br>
          We should be ready to explore all the possibilities to become organic, to get to know where we came from.<br>
          So we can evolve humanity and a part of every animal living on Earth in ourselves.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only to our body but also to our mind.<br>
          The method activates an enormous colossal paradigm shift which we were born with and is present in our deep neurological system.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern scientific research shows that physical exercise influences the central dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic systems<br>
          and your entire mitochondria.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          The interactions between neurotransmitters and their specific receptors are playing a major role in the onset of fatigue during prolonged exercise.<br>
          This proves that any movement brings life and energy to our body and mind. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefor we should get back to the first humans, to Lucy and find that unique style of living and moving that is lost now <br>
          and make it once again our own.<br>
          The key to live a strong, healthy and pain free existence. <br>
