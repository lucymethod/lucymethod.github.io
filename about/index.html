     			<b class="font-larger">The Ideal Urban Human</b><br>
				We all have our own image about what makes a healthy and strong person. <br>
				How we envision this image depends on who we were in the past, who we are now, and who we want to become. <br>
				One constant, no matter the ideal, is that underneath the surface of a strong, fit body is a disciplined and active mind. <br>
				This makes that the true vision of a strong and healthy person is someone with a fit body, and a fit mind as well. <br>
				To learn how to evolve into such a person, we should look back to the dawn of humanity. <br>
			</p>
        	<p>
				<b class="font-larger">History</b><br>
				Lucy Method is based on the discoveries of how our first human ancestors lived, and how modern people live now. <br>
				Lucy Method embraces the lifestyle of emerging homo sapience from 3.2 million years ago. <br>
				That is the Age of Lucy. <br>
			</p>
        	<p>
				Lucy is the name given to a collection of fossilized bones, discovered in Ethiopia in 1974, which made up the first skeleton of the hominin species Australopithecus Afarensis. <br>
				Lucy is the most important fossil discovery in the history of anthropology. <br>
				Those bones showed that Lucy moved upright. <br>
				Looking at her bones, particularly the structure of her knee and spine curvature, scientists determined that she spent most of her time walking on two legs, like us. <br>
				Lucy Method has been developed to emulate how our prehistoric ancestors moved and lived. <br>
			</p>
        	<p>
				<b class="font-larger">Back to the Movement</b><br>
				Lucy Method combines physical exercise with concepts and ideas from out distant past, along with modern knowledge of nutrition and healthy lifestyles. <br>
				The main idea behind Lucy Method is “Back to Movement.” Being on the move was vital to Lucy and our other ancestors’ survival, and it is as vital to us today. Their way to survive is our way to live a healthy life. <br>
				The way we live and work now forces us to be still, and locked in a small spaces for extended periods of time. <br>
				Even in an office with no walls, we are not free to move and live in the way our ancestors and ourselves were built to move and live. <br>
				Lucy Method brings us back to the simplicity and power of movement to fight back against the damage done by the modern lifestyle. <br>
			</p>
        	<p>
				We have been, and always will be a part of evolution. <br>
				We should be willing to explore all the ways to live life in a more organic way like our ancestors did. <br>
				We should do this so we can evolve ourselves into something better, and be part of this living Earth, along with all living species. <br>
				We want to evolve not just our bodies, but our minds as well. <br>
				Lucy Method represents a colossal paradigm shift back to our ancient roots, buried deep within our DNA. <br>
				Scientific research has shown the benefits of physical exercise. <br>
				It stimulates the dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic systems and boosts mitochondrial activity. <br>
				The more we fire up these neuro transmitters, the longer we can remain active before fatigue sets in, whether it’s during prolonged exercise or daily life. <br>
				We know that to move the body is to move the mind. <br>
				To better our bodies and minds, we should return to the unique way of living that Lucy and our ancestors lived. <br>
				We can find what has been lost and reclaim it. <br>
			</p>
        	<p>
				Lucy Method is the key to strong, healthy and pain free existence.<br>
