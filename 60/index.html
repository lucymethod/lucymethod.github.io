				People who want to learn more about Lucy Method can contact us to schedule a 30/30 Consultation. <br>
				The practitioner will get in touch with you, and provide further information regarding our free 30/30 Consultation and pricing. <br>
				In twice 30 minutes, the practitioner will perform a complete movement analysis, at a time and place convenient for you. <br>
				However, make sure that you have plenty of space to move. You’ll need it. <br>
				Public parks in Amsterdam seem to work very well. <br>

      		<p>
				<b>This thorough analysis measures several different individual aspects will be analyzed, like:</b><br>
				<div id="skinny">
				- Anatomy <br>
				- Movement <br>
				- Mobility <br>
				- Endurance <br>
				- Performance <br>
				- Daily life <br>
				- Social behavior & habits <br>
				- Nutrition <br>
				- Cessation <br>
				- Goals <br>
				- Results <br>
			</div>
			</p>
      		<p>
				In the following days after the 30/30 Analysis has taken place, the practitioner will develop a custom 12 week method program. No this isn’t just another exercise routine. <br>
				Lucy Method will be customized accurately to your specific needs found after the 30/30 Analysis. <br>
				From here on you will work on an estimated 12 week based program together with the practitioner. <br>
				Circumstances in a human’s life may make it difficult for them to follow a 12 week program, so Lucy Method also offers single and sessions for two. <br>
				The optimal number of sessions per week will be determined after the 30/30 consultation. <br>
